# Jarvis Test App

> **Built entirely by Jarvis - the first voice-to-voice AI coding agent**

This Next.js dashboard application was created from scratch using only voice commands through Jarvis, demonstrating the power of voice-driven development. No manual coding was required - just natural conversation with an AI agent that understands, builds, and deploys complete applications.

## What is Jarvis?

Jarvis is a revolutionary voice-to-voice AI coding agent that allows developers to build applications through natural conversation. Simply speak your requirements, and Jarvis handles everything from project setup to deployment.
